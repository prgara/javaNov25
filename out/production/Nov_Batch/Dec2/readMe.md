## Programming
- Set of instructions for performing a task
- sequntial set of instruction , Object oriented
- Logical thinking

## Languages 
- Java
- Python
- Ruby
- C#
- JS
- .Net
- C
- C++

## Paradigms
- Object Oriented -> Object & classes
- Procedural
- Sequential
- Functional 

-- Java is Object-Oriented or not ? Primitive data types

# Features of Java
- Secure
- Portability/ Platform independent / WORA -> write once and run anywhere
- Robust
- Static Typed 
- name = "Pragra"

## variable
- container to hold data
- Ref to data
- Value can be changed

let x = 10

## Data types -> Primitive & Non primitive
- int -> Integer -1,2,3,4
- float -> decimal - 1.0,2.0,2.2
- char -> 'A'
- boolean -> true or false
- double 
- short
- long

# bit -> 0 & 1
# 1 byte -> 8 bits
# 1024 Kb -> 1 Megabyte

# primitive -> It is already built in java / given by Java
# Non- primitive -> User defined (String,Array,Classes)

## Operators -> 
- Arithmetic operators -> + - * / % ++ --
- Assignment operator -> = += -= 
- Comparison Opt -> <= >= < > != ==
- Logical operators -> && (AND)    ||(OR)    !(NOT)
