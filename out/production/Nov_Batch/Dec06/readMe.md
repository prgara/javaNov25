## Recap

- Data types -> primitive & non primitive
- Variable -> store a value and value can vary
- Operators -> Arithmetic, Comparison & Assignment


# Primitive -> built in data type
- int
- char
- boolean
- long
- float
- double
- byte


- Arithmetic + - * / % ++ --
- Comparison < > >= <= != ==
- Assignment = += 



## Logical Operator
- AND &&
- OR ||
- NOT !

## Decision-Making

- if it rains then I will carry umbrella
- if it will be sunny then I will carry shades/sunglasses

if (condition) { statement}

if (rain=true) sout("Carry umbrella")

- If 
- if else
- else if
- nested if 


- naming Convention
- Class -> first Letter should capital -> Test test
- variable -> in small/lowercase -> isRaining , IsRaining israining
- CAmel casing -> whereareyougoing whereAreYouGoing

// write a program to check whether a number is positive or negative with help of if else 


// write a program by taking user input to check whether he/she is eligible to drive ( driving age is 18 or above)


// write a program to have 3 int value and check which is largest... find largest num.

> greater than
< less than


# Switch case ->

switch (exp)
case 1:
statement

case2:
statement

......................
WAP
Take a int num, based on num print what day it is
1 - Monday
2-Tuesdy
3-wed
.
.
.
7-Sunday

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter a number : ");
int num = sc.nextInt();

# Loop

- while 
- do-while
- for 
- forEach


- Print num from 1 to N ( N -> user Input)
- Print odd num from 1 to N
- Print evn num from 1 to N
- Multiplication table for 5 
  5 * 1 = 5
  5 * 2 = 10
