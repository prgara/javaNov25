# Recap

how to create an immutable class ? var private & finals, class final, no setters.

Collection - 
Arraylist, linkedList


arraylist is immutable ?  synchronized ?




able to access to private var

give an array [2,4,7,9,4,1]      find the index of elem which returns sum of 10 ------> [3,5]


Manipulation 100 ele  put an ele at index 2, search-intensive (indexes) .get(10)


linkedList -> where we store elements in nodes and each nodes points to the next node. variable in size and
non-contiguous. no indexes in linked list
Types -> Singly linked List (one direction), Doubly(forward + backward) , circular(last point to first)

900 index in arraylist 


1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

head -> ele -el-ele-ele-ele-insert here-ele-

           array list             loinkedlist
search         O(1)                  O(n)
insert         O(n)                  O(1)

ConcurrentModificationException

create alist then iterate with for loop and try to add and remove something from it.
Do the same with help of iterator.
