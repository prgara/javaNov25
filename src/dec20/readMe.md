Array ->

3 students and each one having 3 subjects. we need to store the marks of these subjects for each student.

- Single Dimesional
- Multi dimesional -> 2d, 3d, 4d


 ## 2d ARRAYS

Matrix -> Row & columns

[rows][columns] -> 2d


# WAP to use scanner to create 2D array and then loop over it and create a matrix

# WAP to take two 2D arrays and in the end do sum for it

1 2 3                             1 2 3                                  2 4 6
1 2 3              +              1 2 3              =                   2 4 6

- You can access no static var,method in a static context.


- We don't need to call static block and it is first statemenet to be excuted.

- Instance block
