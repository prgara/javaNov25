## Recap
- String and ways to create
- Stringbuilder & buffer
- Inheritance

String vs stringBuilder vs string buffer
Faster

new -> heap
Literal -> String constant pool
why string is immutable ? -> Memory, String Pool security, Performance


String abc = "something" -> 

Object class is the parent class of all the objects

this refer to current object



-----------------------------------------------

Polymorphism -> many forms, many behaviours, 

type of polymorphism
- CompileTime, Static polymorphism/loading, Method overloading
- RunTime, Dynamic loading, Method Overriding



Method Overloading -> same method name but with diff parameters


- calculate the area of square & rectangle using static binding
- square = side * side
- rectangle -> length * width


- Method Overriding -> own functionality, same method name and different implementation

WAP to do method overriding - Payment -> Credit, debit

Payment -> Credit, debit, Cheque, UPI
Employee -> full time, part time
Area -> square, rectangle, circle, triangleAt runtime it will evaluate and based on the object will
decide which method will be called

Method overriding - it always look first in the child then goes to parent class.



super() ->
