## Recap

- 2d Arrays
- Static -> var, methods, blocks
- stack & heap

# this keyword

It refers to the current object



# String
- Array of characters, sequence of characters
- Non primitive data type

# how to create a String
- String Literal
String str = "Pragra";
- new Keyword
String student = new String("HArry")

# String constant Pool
String are store in string constant pool inside the heap area to optimize memory & performance


- Properties
Strings are immutable (cannot be changed).


name = "Tom"
employee = "Tom"
student = "Tom"

name = "Harry"



wap to revers a string
Pragra -> argarP

## Methods in String
- length
- toLowerCase
- toUpperCase
- split
- substring
- concat
- chatAt
- equals -> check the value, content
- == ->it is used to check the refernce
- trim
- EqualsIgnoreCase

palindrome -> madam, icici, level



wap to check whether a given string is palindrome or not


# StringBuilder & StringBuffer
- These are mutable
StringBuilder is non thread safe  -> fast
StringBuffer is thread safe -> slow


String vs StringBuffer vs String builder




## OOPs -> 4 Pillars
- Inheritance -> inherits property (Attributes, methods) from another class
- Encapsulation -> Bundling of data and methods in a single unit 
- Abstraction -> hiding the implementation and showing necessary features only
- Polymorphism -> many forms -> Ability of a method to behave differently -> Method overriding & method overloading



- Inheritance is used to reuse the code

Employee -> parent class/ super class
  |  extends
  |
Manager -> child class/ sub class


create a vehicle class and create car or bus or truck class 
and inherit the properties from vehicle


# Type of Inheritance
- Single level inheritance
- Multilevel
- Hierichal
- Multiple [Not allowed in java]  -> diamond problem
