Switch case
Loop -> while



Do while loop -> it will execute at least once no matter the condition true or false.

for loop -> for(init;condition;increment)

[//]: # (-> fibonacci -> 1 1 2 3 5 8 13)
-> factorial 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 
Take user input and do factorial ...........

-> 123 - Sum of this num -> 6 , 567 -> 5+6+7 = 18

 123 % 10 -> 3
123/10 -> 12
12%10 -> 2


Break -> escape -> came out of the program/ no other iteration will happen
continue -> skip that iteration if condition is met/true.


Give 3 options to the user and user will select 1 option out of these 3. 
Option 1-> Say hello
Option 2-> Say good evening
Option 3-> Exit
Until and unless user input num 3 you have to keep asking the user for the input. only on num 3 exit the program.

2 -> Good evening
1-> Hello
1-> hello
3 -> exit
