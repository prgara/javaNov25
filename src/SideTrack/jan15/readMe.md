## recap

git branch name
git checkout name


can we work on main branch directly ? → 




merge -> combinng chnages from one branch to another 


2 students and have same notebook copy and write different pages
combining both these writings


We are testing how the merge works



you ahve to make chnages cal file and then you have to merge those back in release
- go to feature branch and make changes in cal file and then add and then commit
- checkout to the destination branch and then use git merge command to merge the code


--- testing merge again for clarity
