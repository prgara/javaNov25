you ahve to make chnages cal file and then you have to merge those back in release
- go to feature branch and make changes in cal file and then add and then commit
- checkout to the destination branch and then use git merge command to merge the code


--- testing merge again for clarity

stash - > temporary stores the changes at a place and can be retrived later when required.

git stash
git stash pop
