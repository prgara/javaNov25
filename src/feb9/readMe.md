ArrayList,LinkedList,HashSet,HAshMap


InstanceOf operator -> used to check object type
Typecasting

Upcasting -> converting  child to parent
DownCasting -> parent ref into child


Maven -> Build automation Tool, build our code into 1 single file, manage dependencies 
Gradle 

Lombok -> it is a library which is used  to reduce the boilerplate code.
it will create .m2 folder and download all the dependencies from the remote (mvn repository)


- create a maven project and import lombok lib and use different annotations
