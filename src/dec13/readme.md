- Recap 
do while loop
for loop
continue
break
- why java is OOP ? 
- what is blueprint -> design to create, map, skeleton, basic structure
- Class is a blueprint to create an object.
- object -> instance of a class


-- Data members/variables/attributes/


-> Create a student class which have name, roll no and class as an attribute.
create some methods -> study, play, sing, eat. call these methods in main class  by creating 2 objects


# Behaviour -> method, function


cannot declare method inside method
sleep(){
walk(){

}

}


Paramantersn -> creatinga method and it accepts params.
Arguments -> when we are calling the methjod and passing the values, it is called args

Instance var -> belongs the class and any method in the class can access it
Local variable -> limited scope and you cannot access it outside its scope.



create a class named employee which will have empId, name, dept and salary and this class will
have a method employeeDetails. in the main class create 5 employee objects and print the details.



Create a calculator class having 4 methods for sum, sub, divide, multiply and
then create object in main class and do basic operations

## arrays

Arrays -> storing similiar kind of values in single var
elements of homogenous type.

it is of fix size,
index starts  with 0

10 elements -> 0 to 9

create an array with 15 elements and print the elements using for loop.


Creating an array

int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};// -> first way

int[] array = new int[10]; // -> second way


- create an array with capacity 10 and take user input to fill the array and then use for
each loop to print the elements
